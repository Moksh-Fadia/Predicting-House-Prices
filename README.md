# Predicting Housing Prices

This project focuses on building and comparing multiple machine learning models to predict housing prices based on various features from the California Housing Dataset.

1) Project Description:

Built multiple regression models to predict house prices using a dataset with features such as population, total rooms, households, and ocean proximity.
Implemented hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV for optimizing model performance.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like RÂ² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Accuracy.

2) Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

3) Models Implemented:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
Support Vector Regressor

4) Key Features:

Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV
Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling)
Model comparison and visualization

5) How to Run:

->Clone the repository.

->Install the required libraries using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

->Place housing.csv file in the root directory.

->Run the main script:
python main.py

6) Results:

The project compares multiple regression models to determine which one provides the best prediction accuracy for the housing dataset.
